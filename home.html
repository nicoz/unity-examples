  <h1><a href="first-demo/first-demo.html">First Demo</a></h1>
  <p>The first demo is simply a navigation-interaction showcase. The character is free to roam the island,
  and to interact with the objects that lay next to him.</p>
  <h1><a href="first-inventory-demo/first-inventory-demo.html">First Inventory Demo</a></h1>
  <p>This demo starts to show the basic structure needed to form a propper inventory system. 
  Feel free to press the "I" key (or to press the small "I" icon on the bottom left corner of the 
  screen and try out the inventory. The inventory objects may or may not interact with the 3D objects
  on screen.</p>
