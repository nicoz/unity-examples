  <h1><a href="first-demo/first-demo.html">First Demo</a></h1>
  <p>The first demo is simply a navigation-interaction showcase. The character is free to roam the island,
  and to interact with the objects that lay next to him.</p>
  <h1><a href="first-inventory-demo/first-inventory-demo.html">First Inventory Demo</a></h1>
  <p>This demo starts to show the basic structure needed to form a propper inventory system. 
  Feel free to press the "I" key (or to press the small "I" icon on the bottom left corner of the 
  screen and try out the inventory. The inventory objects may or may not interact with the 3D objects
  on screen.</p>
  <h1><a href="vertigo1/vertigo1.html">First Person Movement with a real body</a></h1>
  <p>This is a concept I would like to include in my games. I love First Person Shooters, but I really dislike not been able to see my own body (at least my arms and legs), so I made this little demo. 
  Try moving around the scene using the classical movement keys (mouse movement is temporarily disabled. </p>
  <h1><a href="2darcade/2darcade.html">This first part of my official first game</a></h1>
  <p>This is just a concept, the propper game will have different levels, one for each city of various countries of the world. 
  In each level you will have to find the objects named by the game and click them before the time runs out. I will set a timer for 2 minutes. 
  The next demo of this game will have a menu and 3 levels at least</p>
